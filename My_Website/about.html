    <h1> About Me Page</h1>
    <p>   Hello! My name is Yiwen and I'm in 11th grade. My goals are going to UCI and get a job that has high wages. I want to major in computer science in
        college because of how current technologhy is making a great impact on the world. Thus, I hope I can contribute something to the world that will
        also create a big impact. I am looking forward to travel around the world with my family after I gained a lot of money from my occupation. The 
        only thing I like about school is that I get to hangout with my friends! </p>
