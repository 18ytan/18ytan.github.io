        <h3>The purpose of the Snake game is to make the tail grow longer and eat the fruit to get more points.
            For this game that I make on scratch, I used the forever loop to make the snake go in same patterns. 
            I also used "when spaced is press" to let the players to have help options or move around durig the game.
            The difficulties I encountered during the game was I couldn't make the fruit appear again after the snake eats it.
            However, I set it as if the color of the snake is touching the fruit then place the fruit somewhere else in random.</h3>

        <h3>This mermaid fictional story evolves around a mermaid and her bracelet. The plot of the sotry is either to fall in love 
            with a human or to fight against the Evil Queen. To successfully complete the story, creator has to know how to use a 
            loop to continue the story. Also create different conditions of what if certain keys are being pressed. There was a 
            problem that came up while I was working on this story. The problem was I couldn't loop back the decision point 
            to the previous one, but I solved it back writing the function at the end of every decision points. I really 
            like the idea of letting others to make decisions and have a particular ending based on their choices. Recalling
            the stories I have read, I really liked this one story where you have to choose a type of cake for your mom, but 
            when you choose a certain cake it lets to the ending. If I have chance to do this over again, I would like to add 
            more interesting ending.</h3>
